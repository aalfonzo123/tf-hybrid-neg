This is a demo of a hybrid neg using a VM on the other side of a VPC network peering in another project. It is **not** the intended use of a hybrid neg, but it is useful as a proof of concept.

It is only useful as a sample. It is not reusable:
* It doesn't even have variables
* It assumes other elements already exist, such as VPCs and VPC network peerings
